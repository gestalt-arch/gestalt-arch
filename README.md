Decentralized architecture for loss tolerant semi-autonomous robotics

## Objective
We demonstrate a decentralized robot control architecture by which a user-controlled interface prescribes an objective to a robot network. This network is then able to complete the task safely without further guidance from the prescriber and is tolerant to losses within the network.
